# Flask-SQL_Injection-Demo

This repository is built on a Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS using Jinja template engine for the minimalistic frontend. This simple blog was created for the pre-development research at Fasoo. I intentionally added a page that can be attacked with SQL injection for the purpose of R&D.
